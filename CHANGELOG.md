### Algorithm Fixes & Improvements

🐛 **DateTime Extensions**
- Fixed `isBetweenRange` to properly forward the `inclusive` parameter (was being ignored)
- Fixed `isAnnualDateInRange` to correctly handle date ranges spanning year boundaries (e.g., Dec-Feb ranges)
- Fixed `isNthDayOfMonthInRange` cross-year range validation that incorrectly rejected valid months
- Fixed `inRange` and `isNowInRange` to default to inclusive boundary semantics (more intuitive behavior)

🐛 **List Extensions**
- Fixed `equalsIgnoringOrder` to correctly compare duplicate counts (previously `[1,1,2]` incorrectly equaled `[1,2,2]`)

🐛 **String Extensions**
- Fixed `hexToInt` case-sensitive overflow check (lowercase `7fffffffffffffff` was incorrectly flagged as overflow)
- Fixed `toUpperLatinOnly` O(n²) string concatenation - now uses StringBuffer for O(n) performance
- Fixed `upperCaseLettersOnly` O(n²) string concatenation - now uses StringBuffer for O(n) performance
- Fixed `truncateWithEllipsisPreserveWords` to return truncated content when first word exceeds cutoff (instead of just ellipsis)
- Fixed `containsIgnoreCase` to follow standard string semantics (empty string is contained in any string)

🐛 **DateTime Utils**
- Improved `convertDaysToYearsAndMonths` precision using average days per year (365.25) and month (30.4375) to account for leap years
- Added optional `includeRemainingDays` parameter for more detailed output

🧪 **Testing**
- Added 110 new test cases covering all algorithm fixes across respective test files

## 0.5.3+Christchurch

🗑️ Redundant string extension files and their old test files were removed.
🧪 A comprehensive test suite was added for `string_extensions.dart`, ensuring full coverage of the consolidated functionality.

## 0.5.0+Rotterdam
➕ New extension methods were added for numbers, lists, and strings (like forceBetween, order‑agnostic list comparison, and safer string number parsing).
🧪 Fresh test files were created to cover the new extensions, and overall test coverage has been improved.
🔄 Some extension names were refactored for consistency across the codebase.
🧹 Test imports and structures were updated to align with the refactored code.

<!-- cspell: ignore Utrech -->
