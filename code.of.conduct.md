## 1 Harmony

Bad coding is easy. The following rules make code simpler to read, review, maintain, and test. Maintain clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Follow naming conventions, prevent fragile code, be future-proof, and practice defensive programming.

### 1.1 Maintainable Code

*(a)* 🌈 Use consistent and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid abbreviations and ensure names are descriptive of their purpose.

``` dart
    /// Use clear and descriptive names
    void fetchDataFromServer() {}

    /// Use “db” for database operations
    void dbFetchUser() {}

    /// Use “api” prefix for web calls
    void apiFetchData() {}

    /// Combine nouns and verbs clearly
    List<String> getUserList() {}

    /// Use “is” prefix for boolean variables
    bool isLoading = true;
```

*(b)* 📐 Maintain a separation of concerns. Small files and functions streamline code reviews, migrations and merges.

- Separate UI, models, services, and utilities into distinct folders, with patterns like `MVVM` or `Clean Architecture`.
- Keep state management logic separate from UI code, to ensure state changes are predictable and testable.
- Organize files by feature or module, named based on their functionality

*(c)* 🎯 Exit early to avoid nested ifs and separate logic into methods

*BEFORE*: Succinct but difficult to read

``` dart
void checkAge(int age) {
   String result = '';

  if (age >= 18) {
    if (age < 65) {
      result = 'You are an adult.';
    } else {
      result = 'You are a senior citizen.';
    }
  } else {
    if (age < 2) {
      result = 'You are a baby.';
    } else if (age < 13) {
      result = 'You are a child.';
    } else {
      result = 'You are a teenager.';
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

*AFTER*: exit early, separated concerns, validate params, give more options

``` dart
String checkAge(int age) {
  final ageDisplayValue = getAgeDisplayValue(age);
  if (ageDisplayValue == null) {
    return 'Invalid age';
  }

  return 'You are a $ageDisplayValue.';
}

String? getAgeDisplayValue(int age) {
  if (age < 0) {
    return null;
  } else if (age < 2) {
    return 'baby';
  } else if (age < 13) {
    return 'child';
  } else if (age < 18) {
    return 'teenager';
  } else if (age < 65) {
    return 'adult';
  } else {
   return 'senior citizen';
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Respect Our Users and Their Data

> Companies that mishandle sensitive user data face severe legal and reputation consequences. Never risk unauthorized access or data breaches.

*(a)* 🚨 Never log sensitive user information - even to the user’s device. This includes avoiding client-side logging of personal data, authentication tokens, or any information that could compromise user privacy or security. Implement secure hashing or encryption for all outputs that may contain sensitive data.

*(b)* 🔒 When logging is necessary for debugging or analytics, ensure that all logs are anonymized and do not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. Use unique identifiers instead of user-specific information.

*(c)* 🥇 Apply consistent theming and respect accessibility across all UI components to enhance user experience and prevent confusion.

*(d)* 🏆 Always obtain explicit permission before collecting or sharing user data. Clearly communicate data practices to build trust and comply with privacy regulations. Ensure users understand what data is being collected, how it’s being used, and how they can control or delete their information.

*(e)* 📊 Practice data minimization by only collecting and storing information that is absolutely necessary for the application’s functionality. Regularly review and purge unnecessary data.

### 1.3 Future-Proof

*(a)* 💣 Do not write code that will cause issues in the future, such as hard-coded dates or temporary fixes.
*(b)* 🏗️ Plan for the long-term maintainability and scalability of your code.
*(c)* ⚙️ Use configuration files or environment variables instead of hard-coding values.
*(d)* 💎 *Zero* warnings, hacks, or lints. And to-dos need to go in project management tools, never source.

### 1.4 Defensive Programming

*(a)* 🐛 Implement thorough error handling to gracefully manage edge cases, ensuring robust application behavior.
*(b)* ⚠️ Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity:

- Empty and null string checks simplify operations and clarify debugging
- Ensure indices don’t exceed minimum / maximum allowed value (bound errors)
- Validate inputs to prevent malicious characters or invalid data.

> SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, buffer overflow, command injection, DoS, man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking are common examples of malicious inputs that can compromise application security.

*(c)* 💾 Avoid optimistic casting and utilize null safety features to avoid null errors

```dart
  // Optimistic casting (avoid) will *error* if the provided data in missing or a different format
  final nameError = jsonData['name'] as String;

  // Safe casting with `!`:
  final name = jsonData['name'] as String?;
  if (name == null || name.isEmpty) {
    // log or ignore
  } else {
    // do something
  }
```

*(d)* 🧯 Avoid shortcuts that may lead to code breaking under unusual conditions, prioritizing long-term stability.

- Handle exceptions within the method without throwing errors - unless the needed for parental logging.
- Log errors somewhere they can be review, but be mindful or leaking sensitive data

### 1.5 Version Control

*(a)* 🌿 Use feature branches for new development, merging within 1-2 days and incorporating the main branch daily to minimize divergence and reduce merge conflicts.

*(b)* 📝 Use tags and write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes made. Include relevant issue or ticket numbers for easy tracking.

*(c)* 🧪 Ensure all tests pass before creating a pull request; if builds are lengthy, break them into smaller components.

*(d)* 👀 Conduct code reviews within a few hours of submission to maintain development momentum.

*(e)* 🔍 Keep pull requests small and focused on one feature or bug fix; merge approved requests immediately to avoid conflicts with ongoing work.

*(f)* 🚫 *Never* force push to shared branches, especially the main branch; it is only allowed by designated tech leads when absolutely necessary.

*(g)* 📊 Regularly clean up old merged branches by retaining them for at least one release cycle, keeping commented-out sections for context, and documenting significant removals in commit messages or changelogs.

*(h)* 📚 Maintain a changelog that includes major changes, new features, significant bug fixes, deprecated features, and breaking changes while excluding trivial updates unless they affect user-facing functionality.
